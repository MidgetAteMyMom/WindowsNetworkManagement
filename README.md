 C# Static class to change network settings under windows 10

## Contents
 There are two static classes contained in this project. **IPv4Validator** and **NetworkSettingsControler**
 The IPv4Validator can be used do verify ipaddresses and subnetmasks for validity and to check if two addresses are in the same network.
 The NetworkSettingsController class will work ***only** if ran under administrator privilege.* It can be used to set IP-Adresses and Nameservers statically or dynamically.
